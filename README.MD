Image Carousel Slide Show
=========================


This is a challenge set by Founders and Coders academy.  This solution fulfills a number of criteria set-out in the challenge.  I have also added a couple of other things to help with functionality.

### Prerequisites

- Responsive (works on mobile and desktop)
- Display one image at a time
- Move between images when clicking navigation buttons
- Toggle automatically looping through all images with a play/pause button
- Allow keyboard navigation between images with the left/right arrow keys

### Additional features

- ‘Spacebar’ starts and stops the slideshow
- If arrow keys are used then autoplay is paused
- Animation between slides
- Dot indicators at the bottom to show which slide is being displayed
- Navigate to slides using the dots
- Captions and slide-count text
